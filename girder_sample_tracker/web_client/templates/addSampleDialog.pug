            If you're creating a batch of samples use <b>{number}</b> placeholder in the name field to indicate where
            the number should be inserted. You can pad the number with leading zeros by using <b>{number:02d}</b>, where
            02d indicates padding with at most 2 zeros.
            If you don't provide a placeholder in the name field, the name will be used as a common stem for all
            samples, and each sample will be suffixed with a 0-padded consecutive number from 1 to N.
